when i change the select this one will show all the regions of pokemon (except hisui)
after select a region the app will show the pokemon of that region and their important 
information(sprite,pokedex,types,name) after there's a button, when you push the button
the card that contain the info of that pokemon will add to the team(simuling the original game)
